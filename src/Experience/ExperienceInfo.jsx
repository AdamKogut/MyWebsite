  InfoText:
    "I joined The RND Group as an inexperienced college student otherwise known as an intern the summer of 2019. " +
    "There I learned how to problem solve and work as a team when I was paired up with 2 other interns to upgrade " +
    "a tool that the client uses to follow the code quality guidelines and redesign the UI for it.\n" +
    "The RND Group then extended an offer to join them the following June that I happily took. Because of COVID-19 " +
    "I started off as a tester for one of the clients, it was a difficult assignment but I learned a lot about " +
    "the testing process and what goes into verification and validation of a medical device's software. I was on " +
    "that assignment for a couple of months before I moved to be a developer on a larger team of 8. \n" +
    "On that team, I received a lot of help and guidance until I became comfortable and began working on individual features such as " +
    "an integrated video player to show help videos for the instrument. Since then I have worked on 7 additional client " +
    "projects including ones where I was the solo or main developer on the project. The clients I have worked with have " +
    "had various stacks including React/ASP.NET/SQL, WPF/.NET Framework/SQL, and WinForms without a database. This variation has provided me " +
    "plenty of opportunities to learn and grow my craft and from this, I have aided in critical decisions regarding " +
    "the system architecture of multiple projects and the chance to be an interviewer for the intern program " +
    "along with software engineer candidates."

  Title: "Franciscan Health",
  InfoText:
    "I worked at Franciscan Health as an intern in their quality assurance area the summer after my Sophomore year. " +
    "That summer I initiated  multiple upgrades to their automated test development system, I updated their daily meeting notes " +
    "from using Word to using Microsoft OneNote providing a one-stop shop in case they need to look back on something. " +
    "I led the team's upgrade to code source control and GitHub where previously they held code in files on a network drive, " +
    "for these efforts I won the Bright Light award. " +
    "But my main task that summer was to upgrade their Eggplant scripts which are automatic testing scripts used to do " +
    "integration testing from the front end of the website. They used this technology to validate the newest version of " +
    "Epic Hyperspace from their third-party vendor."
